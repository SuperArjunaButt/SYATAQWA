Description             : Halfway up the Miskatonic River in central
                          Massachusetts, between the mostly quiet college
                          town of Arkham and the tourist trap of Dunwich,
                          lies Syataqwa Island.  No one knows how to
                          pronounce that name.  The indigenous tribes claim
                          it comes from an Elder God who built the island
                          untold aeons ago for some purpose best left
                          unexplored.  The average suburbanite, of course,
                          laughs all this off.  Over a century has passed
                          since the Dunwich Horror of 1928 and the incident
                          at Innsmouth that same year, and the hipsters who
                          moved here out of Boston and NYC to start
                          overpriced microbreweries and gastropubs put names
                          like Dagon and Yog-Sothoth on their IPAs and $30
                          pumpkin spice kale salads to give them that #local
                          #cachet #OldOnes.
                          	The Miskatonic University System runs a branch of
                          their Extension Service on Syataqwa Island, mainly
                          to support various archaeological projects, but
                          also to help local small businesses and hold summer
                          classes for their Distance Ed students.  DoomGuy,
                          after the events of Doom 2, returned to Earth and
                          enrolled in Miskatonic's MBA program.  When he
                          stepped off the Dunwich-Arkham ferry one afternoon,
                          however, he found something had gone horribly
                          wrong.  The business instructors uncovered
                          management practices not meant for mortals, and now
                          the geometry of the Peaslee Business Center makes
                          no sense!  The Doom monsters are back, but some of
                          them appear out of nowhere without even a teleport
                          flash.  Someone...or something...is tearing the
                          fabric of reality apart, and it's up to you to stop
                          it!
